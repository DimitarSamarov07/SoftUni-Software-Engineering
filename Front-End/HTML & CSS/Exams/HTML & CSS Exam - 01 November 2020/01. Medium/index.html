                        <mark class="highlight-green">Our sole purpose is to help you find

                        We don’t serve ads—we serve you, the curious
                        reader who loves to learn new things. Medium is home to thousands of independent voices, and we
                        combine humans and technology to find the best reading for you—and filter out the rest.
